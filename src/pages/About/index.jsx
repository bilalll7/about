            Hello! I’m <b>Albilal</b> Bintang Iskandar, and I’m a Junior Web
            Developer who loves coding and learning new things.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve been programming since 2020, and I have never stopped
            programming since then. I might even say I find it fun to program -
            most of the time. I attended vocational high school with major in
            Software Engineering, and I continued my study in Indonesian
            Computer University with major in Informatics Engineering. During my
            time as a student, I’ve been involved as freelance projects, and
            internships. I’ve also been involved in several competitions. More
            on that later!
          </p>
          <p>
            While I know several programming languages, I’m most comfortable
            with JavaScript and PHP. Other languages that I’m familiar with are
            PHP, Java and Python. I’m also familiar with several frameworks and
            libraries, such as React, Vue, Vite, Laravel, Bootstrap, and
            Tailwind. Currenly, I’m exploring Dart - which is a super cool
            language. They have a lot of interesting concepts! Sometimes I wish
            I could use them in my daily job without having to worry about
            confusing my teammates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay, enough talk about programming! Let’s get into my interests. I
            also play games. I play several MOBA games, for example Mobile
            Legends, Wild Rift and DOTA 2. But I focus more on playing Mobile
            Legends. I also had time to participate in the mobile legends pro
            scene up to tier III. I also had the opportunity to jockey for
            mobile legends accounts, tournaments and earn income from there.
            I've spent over 10,000 hours playing it, and I'm still not bored.
            There are many overhaul mods that give the game hundreds of hours
            more play time. Unfortunately (or rather, fortunately), I don't have
            much time left to play games at the moment.
          </p>

            Wow, that’s a lot of things about me! I hope you enjoy reading it.
            If you want to know more about me, feel free to contact me through
            my social media or email. I’m always open to new opportunities and
            new friends. Have a nice day~
          </p>
          <p>Cheers!</p>
